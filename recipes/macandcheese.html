        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This creamy baked mac and cheese recipe is one I first made three years ago when I was in California. When I got back to Texas, I made it for my mom. This is now her favorite macaroni and cheese. She begs me to make it when I come to visit.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package processed American cheese, cut into strips</li>
